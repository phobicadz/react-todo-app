# React Todo App

This is a simple todo list application built with **React**.  It allows users to:

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Remove tasks

The project uses React hooks for state management and is bootstrapped with the
standard `react-scripts` tooling.  Styling is included via plain CSS to keep the
codebase lightweight.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the app.
